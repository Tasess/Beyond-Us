                        <p>Sitting back and watching the night sky with intense curiosity is a normal feeling. It is a feeling
                            that has existed for years and will lead to many more years of discovery and exploration. Our
                            universe is vast, so vast that it's hard to even imagine the distance between us and our closest
                            neighboring galaxy, Andromeda.
                            <mark>Andromeda is 2.537 million light years away</mark>, one light year is about 9,461,000,000,000

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Cosmic Address</h4>
                        <p>
                            We have out own "cosmic address" which is simply our place in our observable universe. Starting from the lowest level, we
                            live on Earth, in our solar system, in the Milk Way Galaxy, within the local group of the Virgo
                            Super Cluster that is in our observable universe.
                            <br>This helps build an understanding of perspective.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Our Sun is one of many in a collection of stars that form into a disk-shape. This our Milk Way galaxy. A galaxy is almost
                            like an island of stars and most range from a few hundred million to more than a trillion; our
                            galaxy is rather large, containing more than 100 billion. This is already amazingly large, but
                            it doesn't even stop there.
                            <br>
                            <br> The local group we live in is a cluster of galaxies, the one we live in has about 40, with the
                            Milk Way being one of the largest. From observations, galaxies tend to have a void between them,
                            almost making a chain.
                            <br> Superclusters are what holds these clusters of galaxy clusters, meaning there is much more out
                            there.
                            <br>All of this makes up what is our Universe, all matter and energy included, and even the voids
                            between everything.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The Expanding Universe</h4>
                        <p>
                            Believe it or not,
                            <mark>our universe is expanding</mark>. By that, I mean that the average distance between galaxies
                            have been increasing with time. To get a better picture, think of raisin bread. As the bread
                            bakes, it will expand, but the raisins inside will not move, despite the distance between them
                            increasing. This is what is happening to our universe. While our galaxy is staying the same size,
                            we are moving further away from our neighbors.
                            <br>
                            <br> The origin of this expansion goes back and estimate of 14 billions years, the
                            <mark>Big Bang</mark>. What is occuring now is a much smaller scale as gravity forces matter together.
                            This is how galaxies and their clusters were formed, as gravity became stronger than the expansion.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Galactic Recycling</h4>
                        <p>
                            Stars and planets are formed when gravity makes clouds of dust and gas to condense together. Stars are not living, but they
                            still have their own "life cycle." When materials in a cloud gets compressed by gravity and becomes
                            dense and hot enough to do nuclear fusion, a star is born. As long as the star can do nuclear
                            fusion, it will "live" until the day it has exhausted all of its fuel. Smaller stars tend to
                            just blow it's content back into space, while massive stars supernovae, a massive explosion,
                            to send it's content back into space. This content that gets blown out mixes with other clouds
                            of dust and gas, and gravity will once again pull everything together to make new stars.
                            <br>
                            <br> Studying this cycle has taught us how deeply connected this is with our own existence. The early
                            universe contained the simplest chemical elements: hydrogen and helium, with very small traces
                            of lithium. We and Earth are primarily composed of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron. These
                            elements came to be due to stars' nuclear fusion, and their explosions after dying.
                        </p>
                        <h4>How do We Know?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Naturally, you would wonder how can claim to know anything when things happened so long ago. It's through light of distant
                            stars and galaxies. Light does take time to travel, and with how distant everything is we see
                            what things were previously, not as they are now. For example, when it comes to the moon, light
                            takes 1 second to get to us, and with the Sun, it is about 8 minutes. Light from distant stars
                            can take years, and this is why we measure distancec in light years. Please note,
                            <mark>Light years is a measure of distance, not time</mark>; It is the distance that light can travel
                            in a year.
                            <br> It is because light takes time to travel that we have learned that the farther away we look,
                            the further back we look in time. If Sirius, our closest star, died right now, it would take
                            8 minutes for us to even know about it.
                            <mark>When studying the universe, it is impossible to separate space and time.</mark>
                            <br>
                            <br>To put it to practice, the universe is about 14 billion years old. If we looked at a galaxy 7
                            billion light years away, we see the universe as it was when it was half its age. A galaxy 12
                            billion light years away, will appear as if the universe was only 2 billions years old. If we
                            tried to look past 14 billion light years, however, we will not see anything. This is where our
                            observable universe ends.
                            <mark>This is not limiting the size, the universe can be much larger, but we have no way of seeing
                                past this boundary.</mark>
                        </p>
                        <h4>The Scale of our Planet</h4>
                        <p>
                            <a href="/Solar" target="_blank">Our Solar System</a> is fairly large. This scaled model should help get a visual understanding
                            of how much distance we have between us and our neighboring planets.

                        <h4>Ancient Civilizations and Astronomy</h4>
                        <p>
                            <mark>Most if not all ancient civilizations practiced astronomy.</mark> It was used to determine time
                            and mark seasons. People have used the Sun to determine time for ages. Many cultures would create
                            large obelisk to serve as clocks, working like a sundial. At night the position and phase of
                            the moon or the constellations visible would tell people what time it was.
                            <br>
                            <br>Structures like the Stonehenge helped determine the season. Templo Mayor in the Aztec city of
                            Tenochtitlán is one of the most marvelous structures. It had twin temples on a flat-top pyramid,
                            someone observing from the opposite side would see the Sun rise directly in between the temples
                            on the equinoxes. Many cultures had building with cardinal direction so that they could mark
                            the sunrise and sunset, and some would have buildings used to mark the Sun's position on special
                            dates.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The Greek</h4>
                        <p>
                            Most of modern science is linked back to the Greeks, this is because they developed three innovations still used today. The
                            first is understanding nature without relying on superstition, the second being the use of mathematics
                            to make sure ideas were precise, and the last being philosophy. Philosophy is not very scientific,
                            but it can help develop the skills necessary to make observations and reason. With these three
                            innovations they would create models of nature, something that we still do today.
                            <br>

                            this was common knowledge by his time, and scholars even had a rough estimate of how large our
                            planet was. In about
                            <mark>240 B.C.E.</mark>, Eratosthenes managed to measure the Earth to be about 46,250 kilometers, not
                            to far off from what we consider the measurement to be (modern measurement of Earth is 40,070
                            kilometers). He did this based off the Sun's position during a Summer Solstice, studying the
                            shadow it caused to determine the radius based off the local well.
                            <br>
                            <br> In c. 260 B.C.E., Aristarchus brought forth the idea of a sun centered model, but it never gained
                            support. In
                            <mark>c. 500 B.C.E.</mark> Pythagoras announced his idea of the Earth being a sphere in the center
                            of the universe. Later, Aristotle observed and cited the curved shadow on the moon during a lunar
                            eclipse as more evidence for a spherical Earth. This lead to the creation of a geocentric model,
                            a model with Earth in the center. Of course, the greeks did not stop there, they continued to
                            make new models, each getting more complex as their theories developed. Eventually, Ptolomey's
                            model became one of the most well known, the
                            <mark>Ptolemaic model</mark>, which represented Greek's idea of "heavenly spheres" with Earth in the
                            center and all planets and an outer sphere held the stars.

                        <h4>Copernicus, Tycho, and Kepler</h4>
                        <p>
                            Fast-forward to 1473, a Polish Astronomer was about to change a few things.
                            <mark>Copernicus</mark>, knew about Aristarchus' ancient heliocentric (sun-centered) idea. He learned
                            to calculate each planet's orbital period around the Sun, and even the relative distance from
                            the Sun in terms of Earth-Sun distance, officially taking Aristarchus' theory well beyond what
                            it was. Despite being confident, he was worried of presenting his ideas, but it worked out when
                            scholars urged him to publish a book which later spread to many other scholars who were drawn
                            to the heliocentric theory. This is what is now known as the
                            <mark>Copernican Revolution.</mark>
                            <br>
                            <br> The main issue faced by most aastronomers is that there was a lack of data. Telescopes were
                            not invented at this point, not until
                            <mark>Tycho Brahe</mark>, an eccentric genius, provided one. He developed pre-telescopic instruments
                            and with this and an observatory built to study the sky, he compiled data and observations with
                            his assistant for three decades. This data collection was one of the best things to happen to
                            astronomy. The only issue is that Tycho never managed to make sense of his observations, and
                            on his deathbed begged Kepler, his apprentice, to succeed where he failed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <mark>Kepler</mark> believed in the idea of perfectly circular orbits and did his best to match the
                            circular motions to Tycho's data. After years he finally found orbits matching Tycho's observations,
                            and eventually abandoned the idea of perfectly circular orbits. Kepler discovered that the planetary
                            orbits had to be ellipsis, if he were to take Tycho's data to heart, and he did. His decision
                            to abandon his own beliefs and to trust the data provided to him was a turning point in the history
                            of science in general.
                            <br>
                            <br> Kepler summarized his discovery into three simple laws still repeated today.

                        <p>
                            Kepler's findings provided strong evidence for Copernicus' beliefs, but many scientist voiced objections to the the Copernican view, with three objections all having roots in the ancient Greeks.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Earth could not be moving because if it were, birds, falling stones, and clouds would be left behind as Earth moved.
                                </li>
                                <br>

                                    Noncircular objects contradict Aristotle's claim that the Heavens, Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, must be perfect and unchanging.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    At the time, no one detected stellar parallax, which is near impossible to detect with the naked eye, and has been one of the few things keeping the heliocentric model from being accepted by all since the beginning of Astronomy.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            Galileo almost single-handedly ruined the Aristotelian view of physics. He used experiments with rolling balls to demonstrate a moving object remains in motion unless a force acts to stop it (which is now remembered in Newton's first law of motion). This explained why objects sharing Earth's motion through space should stay with Earth, rather than fall behind.<br><br>
                            Tycho's observation of a supernova already disproved the belief that the Heavens were unchanging. Galileo disproved the heavenly perfection with his own telescope in the late 1609. With his telescope Galileo found sunspots on the Sun (considered imperfections at the time), along with discovering the mountains, craters, and valleys on the moon.<br><br>
                            Tycho did believe he saw stellar parallax, the issue is he thought the stars were much closer and much fewer. Galileo, with his telescope, could see the Milky Way dissolving into even more stars. He did not prove stellar parallax, but he made a good argument in its favor. It wasn't until Galileo made two of his earliest discoveries that the Earth-centered model was destroyed. His first was observing four moons clearly orbiting Jupiter, not Earth. His second discovery was observing Venus going through phases, proving Venus orbited the Sun.<br><br>
                            On June 22, 1633, Galileo was brought before the Church inquisition in Rome and ordered to keep his claims private. At the time, Galileo was 70, and feared for his life and agreed to keep his claims to himself. In 1757, church officials finally gave up the argument, removing Sun-centered works from their index of banned books, but never formally vindicated Galileo until 1992.
